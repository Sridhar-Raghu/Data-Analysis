    "One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups. Given our prior knowledge of this topic, investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics might be an interesting angle to take. We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points (while this number has changed a few times, the data set for our project is based on 2,400 total points). Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.\n",

    "New York City makes its [data on high school SAT scores](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) available online, as well as the [demographics for each high school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2014-2015/n3p6-zve2).

    "\n",
    "- `total_enrollment` has a strong positive correlation with `sat_score`. This is surprising because we'd expect smaller schools where students receive more attention to have higher scores. However, it looks like the opposite is true -- larger schools tend to do better on the SAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other columns that are proxies for enrollment correlate similarly. These include `total_students`, `N_s`, `N_p`, `N_t`, `AP Test Takers`, `Total Exams Taken`, and `NUMBER OF SECTIONS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both the percentage of `females` (female_per) and number of `females` (female_num) at a school correlate positively with `SAT score`, whereas the percentage of `males` (male_per) and the number of `males` (male_num) correlate negatively. This could indicate that women do better on the SAT than men.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Teacher and student ratings of school safety `(saf_t_11, and saf_s_11)` correlate with `sat_score`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Student ratings of school academic standards `(aca_s_11)` correlate with `sat_score`, but this does not hold for ratings from teachers and parents `(aca_p_11 and aca_t_11)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is significant racial inequality in SAT scores `(white_per, asian_per, black_per, hispanic_per)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The percentage of English language learners at the school `(ell_percent, frl_percent)` has a strong negative correlation with SAT scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `enrollment` seems to have such a strong correlation, let's make a scatterplot of `total_enrollment` vs `sat_score`. Each point in the scatterplot will represent a high school, so we'll be able to see if there are any interesting patterns."
